      Dear ${data.username},<br /><br />Greetings from Cloud Care! We hope
      you're doing well.<br /><br />To enhance the security of your Cloud Care
      account, we have implemented a two-factor authentication (2FA) process. As
      a part of this security measure, you are required to enter a one-time
      password (OTP) to complete the authentication process.<br /><br /><b
        ><strong>Here is your OTP:</strong></b
      >
      ${data.otp}<b><strong> </strong></b>(Note: This code is valid for a single
      use and will expire in <b><strong>one hour</strong></b
      >.)<br /><br />Please use this OTP to verify your identity and finalize
      the authentication process. If you did not initiate this request or if you
      have any concerns, please contact our support team immediately at
